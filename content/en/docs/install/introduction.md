## What is hit?

Hit is a command line program to manage and make HTTP requests.
Hit lets you express complex HTTP requests in plain text files.
Hit supports JSON and YAML to express the body of the request and allows
composition of responses from previous HTTP requests into an HTTP request.

Hit could be compared with GUI-based tools like Postman, Insomnia, Paw, etc.
Hit attempts to solve a problem similar to these tools but using Unix
philosophies and with a focus on a superior command-line experience.

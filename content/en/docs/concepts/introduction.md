## What is hit?

Hit lets you express complex HTTP requests in plain text files and create
workflows out of these requests. It allows you to express complex requests as
composition of responses from previous HTTP requests.

## How does it work?

Requests are defined in `hit` files.
Hit can be compared with GUI-based tools like Postman, Insomnia, Paw, etc.
Hit attempts to solve a problem similar to these tools but using Unix
philosophies and with a focus on a superior command-line experience.

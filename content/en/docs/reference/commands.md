hit's goals is to be as simple and straight-forward to use as possible.
And in that spirit the number of command that hit supports is fairly small.
For hitting HTTP requests, the core `hit` command should be sufficient most
of the time.

For other situations, there are a few other commands avaialble:

## version

Output the version of the hit command.

For example:

```bash
$ hit version
v0.1.0 (commit: f563300)
```
